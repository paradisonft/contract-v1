This repo manages the Paradiso V1 smart contracts.

## Setting up

### VSCode devcontainer

Use the provided VSCode devcontainer to get an environment with the correct tools set up.

- Install Docker
- Install VSCode
  - Install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
  - You do *not* need to install the Haskell extension
- Ensure you have a `~/.cabal/packages` folder. You can create this via `mkdir -p ~/.cabal/packages`; it's used to cache cabal packages.
- Clone this repository and open it in VSCode
  - It will ask if you want to open it in the container, say yes.
  - The first time it will take a few minutes to download the devcontainer image from dockerhub,
  - `cabal build` from the terminal should work (unless you didn't have a `~/.cabal` folder, in which case you'll need to run `cabal update` first.)
  - Opening a Haskell file should give you IDE features (it takes a little while to set up the first time)

Note: This uses the [plutus-starter-devcontainer image on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/plutus-starter-devcontainer), if
you wish to build the image yourself, you can do so as follows:
  - Clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus,
  - Set up your machine to build things with Nix, following the [Plutus README](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/README.adoc) (make sure to set up the binary cache!),
  - Build and load the docker container: `docker load < $(nix-build default.nix -A devcontainer)`,
  - Adjust the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to point to your local image.
